Syntax
======

##PigYacc

**Important**: Part of the syntax for PigYacc is similar to [PigLex](https://github.com/peergum/piglex)'s. Both can be part of the same file without generating
any conflict, and this is even recommended if you use both PigLex and PigYacc.

###comments

* C++ (//...) , C (/* ... */) and bash (#...) style comments are accepted.
* C++ and bash comments are on one line only, but can start anywhere in the line
* C comments can spread on several lines and can start and end anywhere in a line
* C comments cannot be embedded at this time.


###commands

####%include

* **Purpose**: Include source code, useful definitions and macros
* **Usage**: `%include "source"`

####%token

* **Purpose**: Declare tokens that will be used by pigyacc
* **Usage**: `%token TOKEN_NAME[, ...]`
* **Note**: Tokens should be in UPPERCASE

####%output

* **Purpose**: Define the name of the file that will be generated by PigYacc, if any.
* **Usage**: `%output "target"`
* **Note**: The target file is generated by expanding macros defined in the source file.

####%yacc

* **Purpose**: Switch the parser in to rules mode
* **Usage**: `%yacc`


###Grammar Rules

####Format

```
rule_name : expression
    action1 [action2 ...]

rule_name : expression {
    action [action2 ...]
    action3 [...]
    [...]
}
```

####Expressions

Expression are composed of one or more of the following elements, separated by spaces:
* defined tokens (see `%token`)
* strings (`"text"`)
* simple character (`'x'`)

####Recognized Actions

Basic actions are variable assignments, using same syntax as Yacc, with a `$` dollar followed
by the position of the element in the expression (`$1`, `$2`, ...) or `$$` to assign a value
to the rule itself.

Actions can also be macros that are defined in the source file (see `%include`): 

`macro_name([parameter, ...])` calls macro_`macro_name`

parameters can be one or more any expression element, separated by commas

**Notes**:

* Within action blocks, no indentation is necessary, but indenting is recommended anyway, for clarity.
* several actions can fit on the same line, within or without an action block, bu
